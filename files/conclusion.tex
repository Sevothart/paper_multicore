\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper presented an object-oriented design of four uniprocessor real-time 
resource protocols (PIP, PCP, IPCP, and SRP). We have implemented the proposed 
design in an RTOS and measured the memory footprint and run-time overhead of 
the implementation. By compiling and running our implementation in a 
microcontrolled platform, we proved that it allows small memory footprint (from 
296 to 660 bytes, depending on the protocol) and run-time overhead (less than 
20~\si{\micro\second} for 20 tasks). Moreover, we used the run-time overhead to 
analyze how it affects the system schedulability and proved that efficient 
RTOS implementation of uniprocessor resource access protocols has few impact on 
the system schedulability. 

As future work, we plan to extend the design to support multiprocessor 
resource access protocols, such as MPCP and MSRP, then implement these 
protocols in EPOS and repeat the schedulability analysis considering the 
run-time overhead.
